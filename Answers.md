1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a JS library and framework that allows us to build more complex UIs that are interactive and yet not memory
intensive.  It provides a virtual DOM that allows us to hold and manipulate state for components and pass that state through
methods and objects. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
Thinking in react means parsing the app up into smaller usable components. Having these small functional components makes
styling easier and makes our code more DRY as we can add new objects or new pieces of an app at ease.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class/stateful components are mutable and the object values can be changed when they are interacted with in the virtual DOM.
Functional/presentational components have object values that are immutable and can only be manipulated via styling or mapping
over them, filtering them, etc, but the values of those objects can't change.

4.  Describe state.
State is the object data that can be changed with virtual DOM interaction.

5.  Describe props.
Props are the properties of objects and methods before they are mutated.
